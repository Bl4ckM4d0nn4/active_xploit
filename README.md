# active_xploit
A PowerShell script used to enumerates the active processes on the local host and writes them to a formatted table in a text file. The script then compares these processes to a list of exploitable binaries, scripts, and libraries known as LOLBAS. This list is updated regularly at https://lolbas-project.github.io/#

Future development will provide a menu of active exploitable binaries, scripts, and libraries to allow the user to further engage in the exploitation of these processes.
